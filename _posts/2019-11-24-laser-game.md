## the case
Albert Camus, one of Franceâ€™s ranking writers and winner of a Nobel Prize for Literature, was buried today in a cemetery not far from the country home he recently bought in the village of Lourmarin in the south of France. It was while motoring from Lourmarin to Paris last Monday that the Algerian-born writer was killed when the car he was in went out of control and crashed into a tree at the side of a highway, seventy-five miles southeast of Paris.
